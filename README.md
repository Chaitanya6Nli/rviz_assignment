# rviz_assignment

## Overview
The `rviz_assignment` package is designed to provide a framework for visualizing and simulating robotic systems using RViz. This package includes essential files for launching nodes, defining robot models, and storing output data.

## Package Structure
```
rviz_assignment
├── launch
│   └── example.launch       # Launch file for starting nodes and setting parameters
├── urdf
│   └── example.urdf        # URDF model of the robot/system
├── output
│   └── example.txt         # Output data or logs generated during execution
└── README.md               # Documentation for the package
```

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rviz_assignment.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the package directory:
   ```
   cd rviz_assignment
   ```
3. Install dependencies (if any):
   ```
   rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
   ```

## Usage Guidelines
- To launch the package, use the following command:
  ```
  roslaunch rviz_assignment example.launch
  ```
- Ensure that the URDF model is correctly defined in `urdf/example.urdf` for accurate visualization in RViz.
- Check the `output/example.txt` file for logs and output data generated during the execution of the package.
